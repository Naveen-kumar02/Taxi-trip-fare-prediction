# Taxi-trip-fare-prediction
1.The dataset are get from the kaggle . The objective of this project is to predict the taxi trip fare prediciton 
2.The overflow of this project: 
      1.First we can pre processing the dataset after done the preprocessing do the eda part by doing eda we can see how the data is distributed .
      2.This dataset is full of numeric values so encoding is not required for this problem .
      3.Once we done the above process then build the model to predict the taxt fare .
      4.By calculatting the Rmse(root square mean error) we decide which model is the best model .
